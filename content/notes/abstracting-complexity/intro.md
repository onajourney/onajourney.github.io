If I had to think of the main factors that go into developing any piece of software, the following would be at the top: security, efficiency (both in space and time), usability and maintainability.

In the real world, however, development time is a major factor, which means concessions tend to be made. You would likely find a direct correlation between the time allotted to a task and how usable, efficient and secure it is. 

I would like to propose the idea that **maintainability** is the most important factor, based on the following principles: 

- Maintainable software frees up a developer's time. 
- A developer, with more time, writes more secure, efficient and usable software.

Alas, this post, the pursuit of pushing the limits of maintainability in the context of building a web application.
