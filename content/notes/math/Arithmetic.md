# Arithmetic (Greek: Arithmos/number and the suffix -tic, meaning "relating to")

Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of numbers, their properties, and the basic operations performed on them. It is one of the oldest and most fundamental areas of mathematics, forming the foundation for more advanced fields like algebra, calculus, and number theory.

## Representation

Numbers can be represented in different **bases** (or numeral systems). The most common systems include:

- **Base 10 (Decimal)**: The standard system used in everyday life. It uses digits 0–9.
  - Example: \( 123_{10} \) represents one hundred twenty-three.
- **Base 2 (Binary)**: Used in computing and digital systems. It uses digits 0 and 1.
  - Example: \( 101_{2} \) represents five in decimal.
- **Base 8 (Octal)**: Sometimes used in computing. It uses digits 0–7.
  - Example: \( 12_{8} \) represents ten in decimal.
- **Base 16 (Hexadecimal)**: Commonly used in programming and computer science. It uses digits 0–9 and letters A–F.
  - Example: \( 1F_{16} \) represents thirty-one in decimal.

## Categories of Numbers

Numbers fall into different categories based on their properties:

1. **Natural Numbers**: Counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
2. **Whole Numbers**: Natural numbers including zero (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
3. **Integers**: Whole numbers and their negatives (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...).
4. **Rational Numbers**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers and \( b \neq 0 \).
   - Example: \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( -3 \), \( 0.75 \).
5. **Irrational Numbers**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction. Their decimal representations are non-terminating and non-repeating.
   - Example: \( \pi \), \( \sqrt{2} \).
6. **Real Numbers**: All rational and irrational numbers.
7. **Imaginary Numbers**: Numbers that involve the square root of negative numbers.
   - Example: \( \sqrt{-1} = i \).
8. **Complex Numbers**: Numbers that combine real and imaginary parts.
   - Example: \( 3 + 4i \).

## Basic Operations

The four basic operations in arithmetic are:

1. **Addition (+)**: Combining two or more numbers to get a sum.
   - Example: \( 3 + 5 = 8 \).
2. **Subtraction (−)**: Finding the difference between two numbers.
   - Example: \( 7 - 2 = 5 \).
3. **Multiplication (×)**: Repeated addition of a number.
   - Example: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).
4. **Division (÷)**: Splitting a number into equal parts.
   - Example: \( 10 \div 2 = 5 \).

---

## Advanced Operations

Beyond the basic operations, arithmetic includes more advanced concepts:

1. **Exponents**: Raising a number to a power.
   - Example: \( 2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \).
2. **Roots**: Finding the inverse of exponents.
   - Example: \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).
3. **Order of Operations**: Rules for solving expressions (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
   - **PEMDAS**:
     - **P**: Parentheses
     - **E**: Exponents
     - **MD**: Multiplication and Division (equal priority, evaluated left to right)
     - **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (equal priority, evaluated left to right)
   - **BODMAS**:
     - **B**: Brackets (same as parentheses)
     - **O**: Orders (exponents and roots)
     - **DM**: Division and Multiplication (equal priority, evaluated left to right)
     - **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (equal priority, evaluated left to right)
   - **Key Rule**: Operations with equal priority (e.g., Multiplication/Division or Addition/Subtraction) are evaluated from left to right.
   - Example: \( (3 + 5) \times 2 = 16 \).
     - Step 1: Solve parentheses: \( 3 + 5 = 8 \).
     - Step 2: Multiply: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \).

## Properties

Arithmetic operations follow certain properties that make calculations consistent and predictable:

1. **Commutative Property**:
   - Addition: \( a + b = b + a \).
   - Multiplication: \( a \times b = b \times a \).
2. **Associative Property**:
   - Addition: \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \).
   - Multiplication: \( (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c) \).
3. **Distributive Property**:
   - Multiplication over addition: \( a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c) \).
4. **Identity Elements**:
   - Addition: \( a + 0 = a \) (0 is the additive identity).
   - Multiplication: \( a \times 1 = a \) (1 is the multiplicative identity).
5. **Annihilation Property**:
   - Multiplication by zero: \( a \times 0 = 0 \).

## Applications of Arithmetic

Arithmetic is used in everyday life for:
- Counting and measuring.
- Budgeting and financial calculations.
- Solving real-world problems involving quantities.
- Building the foundation for advanced mathematics and science.

## Example Problem

Solve the following arithmetic expression using the order of operations:
$$
(3 + 5) \times 2 - 4
$$

**Solution**:
1. Solve the parentheses: \( 3 + 5 = 8 \).
2. Multiply: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \).
3. Subtract: \( 16 - 4 = 12 \).

The result is **12**.
